# Recognition 

**Recognition** is a suite with a focus in privacy and security. All the tools revolve around password management, or password security. **Recognition** is a Vanilla Python3 suite, meaning know external libraries are needed. **Recognition** is still a work in progress, and is constantly under development.

## How to use

 1. Install Python
 2. Clone Library
 3. Run Programs of Your Choice

The best part of the *Recognition* library is that you  don't need any external libraries. Just download/clone the files and then your set.

## Password Generator

The first tool in the *Recognition* suite is the Password Generator tool. The password generator creates a randomly generated password with 8 letters, 8 numbers, and 8 special characters. All of them are selected at random, using the *random* library in Python. 

## Password Cracker

The second tool in the *Recognition* suite is the Password Cracker tool. The password cracker tool, attempts every ASCII character password possible (within a certain length range). The default range is set to 20 character, but you can change the length to any length. When you run this program, it could take a while. This tool shows the importance of choosing long, complex passwords.

## Password Manager
The third tool in the *Recognition* suite is the Password Manager. The password manager takes in a user inputs for website/login, username, and then generates a password. All of this data is then saved in a CSV file on the host computer. In the future I hope to make the CSV encrypted increasing the secuity of the program, however as it is right now the CSV is in clear text.
